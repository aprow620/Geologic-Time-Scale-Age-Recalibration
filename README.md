Every few years refinements to the Geologic Time Scale are made which can create offsets in the ages between reported data in publications 
that use different age models (e.g, GTS 2004 vs GTS 2012). 

This code performs a cubic spline recalibration from one geologic time scale age model to another using tie points at each stage boundary. An example is provided that demonstrates how
to import your age data and recalibrate to either GTS2004, GTS2012 or GTS2020.
